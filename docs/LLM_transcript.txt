Prompt 1: "what is an invariant in the context of requirements engineering?"
LLM Response 1: "

In requirements engineering, an invariant is a condition or property that must always hold true for a system, regardless of state, time, or execution path.

Think of it as a non-negotiable rule of the system.

Plain-English definition

An invariant is a constraint that the system must never violate.

If the invariant is ever false, the system is incorrect, no matter what feature is being used.

Why invariants matter in requirements engineering

Invariants help you:

Precisely define system correctness

Catch contradictions or missing requirements early

Serve as a bridge between requirements, design, and verification

Provide a basis for formal verification and testing

They’re especially important in safety-critical, financial, or resource-constrained systems.

Examples
1️⃣ Resource management

The total allocated memory shall never exceed available memory.

This invariant must hold:

Before

During

After any operation

2️⃣ Banking system

An account balance shall never be negative.

Even during transfers, failures, or rollbacks.

3️⃣ Authentication system

A user must be authenticated before accessing protected resources.

No exceptions, no “temporary” violations.

4️⃣ Scheduling / allocation (ties nicely to your earlier lab 😉)

For each resource r, the sum of all granted requests for r ≤ capacity(r).

That’s a textbook invariant.

Invariants vs other requirements
Concept	Description
Invariant	Must always hold
Functional requirement	Describes behavior or features
Precondition	Must hold before an operation
Postcondition	Must hold after an operation
Assumption	Expected to hold in the environment

👉 Invariants are stronger than pre/postconditions.

How invariants are written

They’re usually:

Declarative

State-based

Often mathematical or logical

Example:

∀ r ∈ Resources :
    allocated(r) ≤ capacity(r)


Or in plain language:

At all times, allocated resources shall not exceed capacity.

One-sentence takeaway

An invariant is a requirement that defines a condition the system must satisfy at all times, across all states and operations.
